#after a long while of struggle, i finally decided to write something on options strategy
#the biggest issue of options trading is to find the backtesting data
#the most difficult part is options greeks
#after all, data is the new black gold
#here are a couple of websites u can try your luck
#currently they offer free trial for a limited period
# http://base2.optionsdatamine.com/page.php
# https://www.historicaloptiondata.com/
#in order to save u guys from the hassle, I also include a small dataset of stoxx 50 index
#the dataset has 3 spreadsheets, the spot spreadsheet refers to spot price of stoxx 50
#aug spreadsheet refers to options settle at august 2019
#jul spreadsheet refers to options settle at july 2019
# https://github.com/je-suis-tm/quant-trading/tree/master/data

#if you dont know what options straddle is
#i recommend u to read a tutorial from fidelity
#who else can explain the concept of options than one of the largest mutual funds
# https://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/investment-products/options/options-strategy-guide/long-straddle
#in simple words, options are a financial derivative 
#that enables u to trade underlying asset at certain price in the future
#and options straddle enable you to profit from a certain level of volatility
#in this script, we are only gonna talk about long straddle
#basically long straddle implies buy call option and put option of same strike price and same strike date
#preferably at the same option price as well
#otherwise asymmetric option price means there is more one-sided risk than the other
#you may wanna consider strangle or strap/strip in this case
#short straddle is literally shorting call option and put option of the same strike price and the same strike date
#preferably at the same option price as well
#long straddle has unlimited profit for upside movement and limited loss
#short straddle has unlimited loss for upside movement and limited profit
#short straddle is commonly used in a sideway market
#long straddle is commonly used in event driven strategy

#for instance, brexit on 30th of October 2019, its do or die, no ifs and buts
#if bojo delivers a no-deal Brexit, uk sterling gonna sink
#or he secures a new deal without backstop from macron and merkel
#even though unlikely, uk sterling gonna spike
#or he has to postpone and look like an idiot, uk sterling still gonna surge
#either way, there will be a lot of volatility around that particular date
#to secure a profit from either direction, that is when options straddle kick in

#but hey, options are 3 dimensional
#apart from strike date, option price, which strike price should we pick
#well, that is a one million us dollar question
#who says quantitative trading is about algos and calculus?
#this is when u need to consult with some economists to get a base case
#their fundamental analysis will determine your best/worst scenario
#therefore, u can pick a good strike price to maximize your profit
#or the simplest way is to find a strike price closer to the current spot price

#nevertheless, as u can see in our stoxx 50 dataset
#not all strike price offer both call and put options
#and even if they offer both, the price of options may be very different
#there could be more upside/downside from the market consensus
#we can pick the options which offer both call and put options
#and we only trade when both option prices are converging
#and please donâ€™t arrogantly believe that you outsmart the rest of the players in the market
#all the information you have obtained from any tips may have already been priced in
#finding a good pair of call and put options at the same strike price,
#the same strike date and almost the same price is tough

#to make our life easier, we only consider european options with cash settlement in this script
